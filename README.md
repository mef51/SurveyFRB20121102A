## Measurements and Figures

All measurements and plots of the bursts are available in the [`results/`](results/) folder.
Each row lists the burst name and DM the measurements were performed at. Each burst is measured over a range of DMs between 555 to 575 pc/cm^3.

Measurements are available as `csv` spreadsheets. Spreadsheets are broken down by their respective publication. For a spreadsheet with all bursts combined see ['AllMeasurements_10003rows_Aug27.csv'](results/AllMeasurements_10003rows_Aug27.csv). These spreadsheets can be loaded in any spreadsheet program or with `pandas`. For example:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('AllMeasurements_10003rows_Aug27.csv').set_index('name')
```

Below is figure showing an example measurement. Figures analogous to the one shown below for all bursts and at each DM are available as large PDF files provided via request.
