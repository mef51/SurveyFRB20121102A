* i can read the kirsten bursts
* the STARE2 burst is the third burst in the pulse train where the 2 CHIME bursts happen earlier. Very happy trombone
* not sure what dfdt is giving me

* chime detections yield stripey autocorrelations due to the noise so I'm going to use the ARO detection instead
	* ARO snr has less noise but snr is much lower so autocorrelation is bad.. maybe I can remove some noise? The plot in the paper seems clearer
	* component 1 seems to have a thin and fat component
* for meeting:
	* dfdt
	* bursts
