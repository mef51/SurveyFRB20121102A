## finalizing aug 26

* footnotes to explain FRB naming convention
* footnotes to explain sub-burst drift/sub-burst slope
* github links for frb gui and measurements
* big spreadsheet of all measurements for last paper
* change header formatting. i think it will look nice with chapter header
* add martin's acknowledgements to last paper
* rajabi chapter uses drift instead of slope, add a footnote maybe
